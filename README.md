# Social-Media-App

Social Media can be a negative and at times, also harmful place, as individuals feel free to say whatever they want to without having to worry about the consequences. Furthermore, nearly all the current social media apps focus on user engagement, rather than reducing hatred or toxicity. 

In this project, we have made a basic Social Media app themed around fitness goals using JavaFX. The comments are moderated using an NLP model whose threshold can be changed according to what the user desires. The app uses SQL database and is able to perform all CRUD operations. The simple goal of this project is to demonstrate JDBC functionalities with CRUD, making a user friendly and aesthetically pleasing front end and lastly, demonstrating that it is possible to have a safe space online, while still being part of an online community.
